=head1 NAME

[% config.base %] - [% config.abstract %]

[% INCLUDE "warning" %]

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $png = [% config.base %]->new ();
    $png->read_file ("crazy.png");
    printf "Your PNG is %d x %d\n", $png->width, $png->height;

=head1 General methods

=head2 read_file

    $png->read_file ("crazy.png")
        or die "Can't read it: " . $png->error ();

=head2 write_file

    $png->write_file ("crazy.png")
        or die "Can't write it: " . $png->error ();

=head2 data

     my $data = $png->data ();

Get the PNG binary data.

=head2 error

Print the most recent error message.

=head1 PNG header-related methods

These methods are related to the PNG header (the IHDR chunk of the PNG
file). 

=head2 width

    my $height = $png->width ();

Get the width of the current PNG image.

=head2 height

    my $height = $png->height ();

Get the height of the current PNG image.

=head2 color_type

    my $color_type = $png->color_type ();

Get the name of the colour type of the current PNG image. The possible
return values are

=over

=item PALETTE

=item GRAY

=item GRAY_ALPHA

=item RGB

=item RGB_ALPHA

=back

=head2 bit_depth

    my $bit_depth = $png->bit_depth ();

Get the bit depth of the current PNG image.

=head2 interlacing_method

    my $interlacing_method = $png->interlacing_method

Get the name of the method of interlacing of the current PNG image.

There is no method for dealing with the compression method
field of the header, since this only has one possible value.

=head1 Image data-related methods

=head2 rowbytes

    my $rowbytes = $png->rowbytes;

This method returns the number of bytes in each row of the image. If
no image has been read yet, it returns the undefined value.

=head2 rows

    my $rows = $png->rows;

This method returns the rows of the image as an array reference which
contains a number of elements equal to the height of the image. Each
element has the length of the number of bytes in one row (as given by
L<rowbytes>) plus one final zero byte. The row data returned is binary
data and may contain several bytes with the value zero.

=head1 Non-image chunks

=head2 text

    my @text = $png->text;

Get the text chunks of the image. Each chunk is a hash reference with
the keys being the fields of the PNG text chunk and the values being
the values of those fields.

=head2 time

    my $time_ref = $png->time;
    print "The PNG was last modified in $time_ref->{year}.\n";

Get the last modified time of the image. The return value is a hash
reference containing six fields,

=over

=item year

=item month

=item day

=item hour

=item minute

=item second

=back

These represent the last modification time of the image. The
modification time of a PNG file is meant to be in the GMT (UCT) time
zone so there is no time zone information in this.

If there is no last modification time, a hash reference is returned
but it doesn't contain any fields.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

There are some convenience functions in this module, exported on request.

=head2 display_text

     use [% config.base %] qw/display_text/;
     my @text = $png->text;
     display_text ($text[3]);

Display the text chunk given as an argument on C<STDOUT>.

This is meant as a minimal convenience function for when you are
debugging or something rather than a general-purpose text chunk
display routine.

=head1 SUPPORT

There is a mailing list for this Perl module at Google Groups. If you
have a question or suggestion or bug report, please let me know via
the mailing list. You don't have to join the mailing list to post a
message.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 In this distribution

=head3 [% config.base %]::Const

L<[% config.base %]::Const> contains the libpng constants taken from the libpng
header file "png.h".

=head3 [% config.base %]::Libpng

L<[% config.base %]::Libpng> provides a Perl mirror of the interface of the C
PNG library "libpng". [% config.base %] is built on top of this module.

=head2 libpng download

If you need to download libpng, see
L<http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>. See also L</Alien::PNG>.

=head2 Other Perl modules on CPAN

=head3 Image::ExifTool

L<Image::ExifTool> is a pure Perl (doesn't require a C compiler)
solution for accessing the text segments of images. It has extensive
support for PNG text segments.

=head3 Alien::PNG

L<Alien::PNG> claims to be a way of "building, finding and using PNG
binaries". It may help in installing libpng. I didn't use it as a
dependency for this module because it seems not to work in batch mode,
but stop and prompt the user. I'm interested in hearing feedback from
users whether this works or not on various platforms.

=head3 Image::PNG::Rewriter

L<Image::PNG::Rewriter> is a utility for unpacking and recompressing
the IDAT (image data) part of a PNG image.

=head2 About the PNG format

=head3 PNG The Definitive Guide by Greg Roelofs

The book "PNG - The Definitive Guide" by Greg Roelofs, published in
1999 by O'Reilly is available online at
L<http://www.faqs.org/docs/png/>. I didn't refer to this book at all
in making [% config.base %], so I can't vouch for it, but looking at the
contents pages it appears to contain a lot of useful information,
although it is definitely showing its age, with chapters about
software such as Netscape Navigator and BeOS.
